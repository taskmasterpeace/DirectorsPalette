## ‚ùì **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **General Usage**

**Q: Why use templates instead of starting from scratch?**  
A: Templates save time and provide proven starting points. They're especially useful for testing and learning the application.

**Q: What's the difference between @artist name and description mode?**  
A: Name mode shows "Jay-Z" (reusable as template), description mode shows "A confident Black male rapper..." (specific for this project).

**Q: Can I edit shots after they're generated?**  
A: Currently no individual editing, but you can generate additional shots or use bulk export with prefix/suffix to modify all shots.

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: Why does export take a few seconds?**  
A: The system processes all shots, replaces variables, applies formatting, and prepares the final output. Complex projects with many shots take longer.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**  
A: No, the AI generation requires internet connection. However, generated content is saved locally for offline viewing.

**Q: What file formats are supported for export?**  
A: Text (.txt), JSON (.json), CSV (.csv) formats. All formats include your shots with applied formatting.

### **Troubleshooting**

**Q: "Extract References" button doesn't work**  
A: Ensure you have internet connection and OpenAI API key is configured. Try refreshing the page.

**Q: Export dialog shows 0 shots**  
A: Make sure you've generated shots first. The export function only works after successful shot generation.

**Q: Copy to clipboard fails**  
A: Try the download option instead. Some browsers have strict clipboard permissions.
