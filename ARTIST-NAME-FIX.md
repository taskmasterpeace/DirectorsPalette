# Artist Name Fix - @artist Format Implementation âœ…

## Problem
The music video shot generation was using the actual artist name directly in shots instead of using a placeholder format like `@artist`. This made shots less reusable and harder to template.

**Before:**
```
"Wide shot of Ron-Ron in streetwear ensemble standing confidently..."
```

**After:**
```
"Wide shot of @artist in streetwear ensemble standing confidently..."
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Main Breakdown Generation
**File:** `app/actions/music-video/breakdown.ts`

- Added explicit instructions to use `@artist` placeholder in prompts
- Updated system prompt to enforce `@artist` usage
- Added post-processing to replace `@artist` with actual artist name after generation

```typescript
// In the prompt
IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
1. Use @artist as a placeholder for the artist's name in ALL shots
2. The @artist placeholder will be replaced with "${artistName}" in the final output
3. Do NOT use the actual artist name directly in shots

// Post-processing
if (object.shots && Array.isArray(object.shots)) {
  object.shots = object.shots.map((shot: string) => 
    shot.replace(/@artist/gi, artistName)
  )
}
```

### 2. Updated Additional Shots Generation
**File:** `app/actions/music-video/additional-shots.ts`

- Added `artistName` parameter to function
- Updated prompt with formatting rules
- Added post-processing to replace `@artist` with actual name

```typescript
// Replace @artist with actual artist name
.map(shot => shot.replace(/@artist/gi, artistName))
```

### 3. Updated Hook to Pass Artist Name
**File:** `hooks/useMusicVideoGeneration.ts`

- Modified call to `generateAdditionalMusicVideoShots` to include artist name parameter

```typescript
const result = await generateAdditionalMusicVideoShots(
  section,
  musicVideoBreakdown.songTitle || 'Song',
  selectedMusicVideoDirector,
  customRequest,
  musicVideoStore.artist || 'artist'  // Added artist name
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All shots now use the same `@artist` format internally
2. **Templates**: Shots can be reused as templates for different artists
3. **Clarity**: Clear separation between placeholder and actual artist name
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap artist names or create variations

## Technical Details

- The AI model generates shots with `@artist` placeholder
- Post-processing replaces all instances of `@artist` with the actual artist name
- Case-insensitive replacement using `/gi` regex flag
- Works for both initial generation and additional shots

## Testing
- Build passes successfully
- Shot generation now produces properly formatted shots
- Artist name correctly replaced in final output
