feat: Artist description replacement system & copy functionality
```

### PR Description
```markdown
## üé® Overview
This PR adds a powerful artist description replacement system and comprehensive copy functionality for shot management, significantly improving the user experience for video production workflows.

## ‚ú® Major Features

### 1. Artist Description Replacement System üé≠
- **Visual Description Field**: New textarea for detailed artist descriptions
- **Toggle Display**: Switch between `@artist` variable and full descriptions
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant switching with "Show @artist" / "Show Descriptions" buttons
- **Smart Copy**: Respects toggle state when copying shots

#### Example:
Artist: Ron-Ron
Description: "Ron-Ron, a confident Black man with gold chains, designer streetwear, face tattoos"

Variable Mode: "Wide shot of @artist walking through urban streets..."
Description Mode: "Wide shot of Ron-Ron, a confident Black man with gold chains, designer streetwear, face tattoos walking through urban streets..."

### 2. Copy Functionality for Shots üìã
- **Individual Copy**: Hover-activated copy buttons on each shot
- **Multi-Select Mode**: Checkboxes for bulk selection
- **Bulk Operations**: "Select All", "Copy Chapter/Section", "Copy All"
- **Universal**: Works in both Story and Music Video modes
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm successful copies

### 3. @artist Variable Format üîÑ
- Shots display `@artist` as a reusable variable placeholder
- AI generates shots with `@artist` instead of hardcoded names
