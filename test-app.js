const testStory = `The Three Little Pigs

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build their own houses. 
The first pig built his house from straw, the second from sticks, and the third from bricks.
Along came a big bad wolf who wanted to eat the pigs. He blew down the straw house, 
then the stick house, but couldn't blow down the brick house.`;

City lights are calling out my name
Dancing through the streets without shame

Chorus:
We're alive, we're alive tonight
Under neon skies so bright

Verse 2:
Lost in rhythm, hearts beating as one
This night has only just begun`;
