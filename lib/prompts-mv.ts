ðŸŽ¯ DIRECTOR NOTES - HIGHEST PRIORITY (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
${ctx.directorNotes || "No specific director notes provided."}

THESE DIRECTOR NOTES ARE MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS. Every treatment MUST incorporate and honor these specific instructions. If director notes specify particular themes, styles, locations, moods, or visual elements, ALL treatments must reflect these requirements.

CRITICAL STYLE RESTRICTIONS:
- NEVER use neon, cyberpunk, holographic, or futuristic themes
- NEVER suggest neon lighting, neon signs, or neon colors
- NEVER use cyberpunk aesthetics, digital effects, or sci-fi elements
- Focus on organic, natural, urban, desert, studio, or classic cinematic styles
- Use warm lighting, natural colors, and realistic environments

DIRECTOR STYLE PROFILE:
${ctx.directorStyle}

ARTIST PROFILE:
${ctx.artistProfileStr}

VIDEO CONCEPT / STORY:

TREATMENT GENERATION RULES:
1. START with the director notes - these are non-negotiable requirements
2. INCORPORATE the artist's identity, style, and preferences from their profile
3. Build treatments that honor BOTH director vision AND artist authenticity
4. Ensure director notes criteria appear in concept, visual theme, and hook strategy
5. If director notes conflict with artist profile, PRIORITIZE director notes while finding creative ways to still honor the artist
6. Each treatment must authentically reflect the artist's brand, stage presence, and visual identity
7. Verify each treatment addresses director notes AND respects artist profile

BALANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Director Notes: PRIMARY creative direction (highest priority)
- Artist Profile: ESSENTIAL character and authenticity (must be respected)
- Director Style: SUPPORTING aesthetic framework (guides overall approach)

Each treatment must authentically reflect BOTH the director's explicit requirements AND the artist's identity/brand.
The artist's fashion style, personality, hometown, and visual preferences should influence wardrobe and location choices.
AVOID: neon, cyberpunk, holographic, futuristic, digital, sci-fi themes.
PREFER: natural, urban, studio, desert, cinematic, organic styles that match both director notes and artist profile.

ðŸŽ¯ DIRECTOR NOTES - HIGHEST PRIORITY (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):

PROPS:

Ensure shots reference configured items using @handles (e.g., @location1, @outfit2, @prop3).

ARTIST AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Include artist presence and performance specifics informed by the Artist Profile
- Respect artist's fashion style, personality traits, and visual preferences  
- Honor artist's hometown, cultural background, and identity
- Incorporate artist's signature moves, quirks, and performance style
- Ensure wardrobe aligns with artist's established visual brand
- Location choices should resonate with artist's background when possible

IMPORTANT: The "shots" field must be an array of STRINGS, not objects. Each shot is a single descriptive string.

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Artist "${ctx.artist}" MUST be referenced using combined artist_wardrobe format
- NEVER use separate references like "${artistToReference(ctx.artist)} wearing @outfit1"
- ALWAYS use combined format: @${ctx.artist.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '')}_wardrobestyle
- Examples: @d_streetwear, @d_formalwear, @d_casualwear, @d_vintage
- Locations use @reference (e.g., @location1, @location2)  
- Props use @reference (e.g., @prop1, @prop2)
- Supporting actors use @ references (e.g., @dancer1, @extra1)

WARDROBE ASSIGNMENT FOR SECTION "${ctx.sectionTitle}":
- Use ONLY combined artist_wardrobe format: @${ctx.artist.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '')}_streetwear
- Different sections should use different wardrobe styles for visual variety
- Wardrobe styles: streetwear, formal, casual, vintage, athletic, bohemian, grunge, etc.
- Each reference is ONE WORD combining artist + underscore + wardrobe style

Example shots for artist "${ctx.artist}":
"Wide shot of @d_streetwear performing in @location1, dramatic lighting emphasizing the urban environment"
"Close-up on @d_formalwear showing raw emotion as they deliver the hook, @prop1 visible in background"
"Tracking shot following @d_casualwear through @location2, fish-eye lens creating surreal perspective"

PERFORMANCE RATIO GUIDELINES BY TREATMENT TYPE:

- Abstract/experimental treatments: 0.3-0.7 ratio (varies by concept)

Adjust performance ratio based on the selected treatment concept and section type.
