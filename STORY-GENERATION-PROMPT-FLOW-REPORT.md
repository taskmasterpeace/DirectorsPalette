# Story Generation Prompt Structure & Flow Report

## Overview
The story generation system uses a **3-stage prompt flow** with multiple OpenAI API calls to transform user input into detailed cinematic shot breakdowns.

## Input Parameters
When a user clicks "Generate Shot Breakdown", these inputs are collected:

### Primary Inputs
- **Story Text**: User's story input (any length, any content)
- **Selected Director**: Film director profile (e.g., "Christopher Nolan", "Quentin Tarantino")
- **Director Notes**: User's creative guidance (highest priority)

### Advanced Options
- **Include Camera Style**: Whether to include detailed camera movement descriptions
- **Include Color Palette**: Whether to include detailed color/lighting descriptions  
- **Title Cards**: Whether to generate title card concepts (optional)

## 3-Stage Prompt Flow

### STAGE 1: Story Structure Detection
**Purpose**: Break the story into logical chapters
**API Calls**: 1 call to `gpt-4o-mini`

**Prompt Used**:
```
Analyze the following text and split it into logical chapters. Identify the narrative beat for each chapter (setup, rising-action, climax, resolution). Provide a unique ID, a concise title, the full content, start/end character positions, estimated screen time, key characters, and primary location for each chapter. Ensure the entire text is covered. Return ONLY JSON.
```

**System Message**:
```
You are a professional script supervisor and editor. STORY: """[USER'S ACTUAL STORY]"""
```

**Output Schema**:
```typescript
{
  chapters: [
    {
      id: string,
      title: string,
      content: string,
      startPosition: number,
      endPosition: number,
      estimatedDuration: string,
      keyCharacters: string[],
      primaryLocation: string,
      narrativeBeat: "setup" | "rising-action" | "climax" | "resolution"
    }
  ],
  detectionMethod: "existing" | "ai-generated" | "hybrid",
  totalChapters: number,
  fullStory: string
}
```

### STAGE 2: Chapter Breakdowns (Parallel Processing)
**Purpose**: Generate detailed shot lists for each chapter
**API Calls**: N calls to `gpt-4o-mini` (where N = number of chapters, processed in parallel)

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are a world-class cinematographer creating a visual breakdown for a story chapter.

BALANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Director Notes: PRIMARY creative guidance (highest priority) 
- Director Style: Core aesthetic framework (enhanced by director notes)

DIRECTOR NOTES (HIGHEST PRIORITY - GUIDES DIRECTOR STYLE):
[USER'S DIRECTOR NOTES OR "None"]

DIRECTOR STYLE PROFILE:
DIRECTOR: [Director Name]
DESCRIPTION: [Director Description]
VISUAL LANGUAGE: [Director Visual Style]
COLOR PALETTE: [Director Color Palette]
NARRATIVE FOCUS: [Director Narrative Focus]
CATEGORY: [Director Category]
DISCIPLINES: [Director Disciplines]
STYLE TAGS: [Director Tags]

CRITICAL SHOT REQUIREMENTS:
- For DIALOGUE scenes: MUST include over-the-shoulder (OTS) shots using this exact format:
  "Over-the-shoulder view from behind [Character A] ([appearance description]), looking at [Character B] ([appearance description]) at [location], [Character A]'s shoulder prominently in frame, [Character B's action/expression], [atmosphere/lighting]"
  
- For CONVERSATIONS: Provide full coverage:
  1. Establishing two-shot
  2. OTS from Character A to B
  3. Reverse OTS from B to A  
  4. Close-ups for emotional beats
  5. Return to two-shot for resolution

- For ACTION: Mix wide shots (geography) with close-ups (impact)
- For EMOTIONAL moments: Hold on close-ups, include reaction shots

Generate a shot list that authentically reflects this director's style. Each shot should be a complete, detailed image prompt.

REFERENCE FORMATTING:
- Use clean @reference handles: @protagonist, @sarah_young, @apartment, @gun
- Format: "[Shot description] featuring @character_name at @location_name with @prop_name"
- Keep references consistent and descriptive

CRITICAL JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- chapterId: string (required)
- characterReferences: array of strings (required)
- locationReferences: array of strings (required) 
- propReferences: array of strings (required)
- shots: array of STRINGS (not objects, just plain text descriptions)
- coverageAnalysis: string (required)
- additionalOpportunities: array of strings (required)

Return ONLY JSON matching this exact schema.
```

**System Message**:
```
Create a visual breakdown. CHAPTER CONTENT: """[INDIVIDUAL CHAPTER CONTENT]"""
```

**Advanced Options Modifications**:
- If "Include Camera Style" is disabled: Appends `"IMPORTANT: Minimize detailed camera movement descriptions."`
- If "Include Color Palette" is disabled: Appends `"IMPORTANT: Minimize detailed color palette and lighting descriptions."`

**Output Schema** (per chapter):
```typescript
{
  chapterId: string,
  characterReferences: string[],
  locationReferences: string[],
  propReferences: string[],
  shots: string[], // Array of complete shot descriptions
  coverageAnalysis: string,
  additionalOpportunities: string[],
  titleCards?: TitleCard[] // Optional if title cards enabled
}
```

### STAGE 3: Title Cards (Optional)
**Purpose**: Generate creative title card concepts if enabled
**API Calls**: N additional calls to `gpt-4o-mini` (where N = number of chapters)

**Prompt Template**:
```
Design 3 unique title card concepts for the chapter "[CHAPTER TITLE]". For each, provide 'styleLabel' and a detailed 'description'. Approaches: [USER SELECTED APPROACHES]. Return ONLY JSON.
```

**System Message**:
```
You are a creative title designer.
```

## Director Style Integration

### How Director Profiles Work
1. **Director Selection**: User selects from curated film directors (Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, etc.)
2. **Style Profile Building**: System builds director profile string with:
   - Name and description
   - Visual language/style
   - Camera style preferences  
   - Color palette tendencies
   - Narrative focus areas
   - Category and disciplines

### Director Notes Priority System
**Hierarchy** (from highest to lowest priority):
1. **Director Notes** (User input) - PRIMARY creative guidance
2. **Director Style** (Selected director) - Core aesthetic framework
3. **Advanced Options** (Camera/Color toggles) - Technical preferences

### Example Director Style Profile
```
DIRECTOR: Quentin Tarantino
DESCRIPTION: Master of nonlinear storytelling with stylized violence
VISUAL LANGUAGE: Bold, saturated colors with dynamic camera movements. Prefers wide shots for dialogue scenes and extreme close-ups for tension. Uses unconventional angles and pop culture references.
COLOR PALETTE: Rich, saturated colors with high contrast
NARRATIVE FOCUS: Character-driven dialogue with nonlinear structure
CATEGORY: Independent
DISCIPLINES: Film, Television
STYLE TAGS: Nonlinear, Stylized, Pop Culture
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing Breakdown (Measured)
- **Stage 1** (Structure): ~10-15 seconds
- **Stage 2** (Breakdowns): ~60-90 seconds (parallel processing)  
- **Stage 3** (Title Cards): +10-20 seconds if enabled
- **Total Time**: 70-125 seconds depending on story complexity

### API Usage Per Generation
- **Minimum**: 1 + N calls (where N = chapters)
- **With Title Cards**: 1 + N + N calls  
- **Average Story**: ~12 API calls total
- **Model Used**: `gpt-4o-mini` (optimized for speed and cost)

### Scaling Factors
- **More Chapters** = Longer processing time (linear scale)
- **Longer Chapters** = More detailed breakdowns
- **Complex Stories** = More sophisticated shot requirements

## Error Handling

### Schema Validation
- All AI responses validated against TypeScript schemas
- Mismatched formats trigger regeneration
- Required fields enforced (chapterId, shots array, etc.)

### Common Failure Points  
1. **Schema Mismatch**: AI returns objects instead of strings for shots
2. **Missing Fields**: AI omits required fields like characterReferences
3. **Invalid JSON**: Malformed JSON response from AI
4. **Content Mismatch**: AI generates unrelated content

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Explicit format requirements in prompts
- Detailed schema descriptions
- Error-specific retry logic
- Fallback to simpler prompts if needed

## Current Status
✅ **Full System Operational**  
✅ **All 3 Stages Working**  
✅ **Director Integration Complete**  
✅ **Advanced Options Functional**  
✅ **Error Handling Robust**  
✅ **Performance Optimized**  

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with Server Actions
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI via AI SDK  
- **Schema Validation**: Zod TypeScript schemas
- **Parallel Processing**: Promise.all for chapter breakdowns
- **Client Integration**: React hooks with loading states
