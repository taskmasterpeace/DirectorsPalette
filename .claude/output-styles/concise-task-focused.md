# Concise Task-Focused Output Style

## Core Principles
- **Brevity First**: Maximum 3-4 lines per response unless complexity demands more
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what's being done, not why
- **Results-Driven**: Show outcomes, skip explanations
- **Task Completion**: Always verify work before marking done

## Response Format

### Standard Responses
- Direct answers only
- No preambles or conclusions
- Code/commands without explanation unless asked
- One-word answers when appropriate

### Task Execution
```
1. State action (1 line)
2. Execute
3. Confirm result (1 line)
```

### Code Changes
- Show only the changed lines
- File path + line numbers
- No code walkthroughs

## Workflow Rules

### Testing Protocol
```bash
npm run test        # Always before marking done
npm run build       # Verify production readiness
npx playwright test # For UI changes
```

### Task Master Integration
- Use `task-master next` to get tasks
- Update with `task-master set-status --id=X --status=done`
- No verbose task descriptions

### Git Commits
- One-line commit messages
- Format: `type: action (task-id)`
- Example: `fix: auth bug (1.2)`

## Communication Style

### DO
✓ "Fixed in auth.ts:42"
✓ "Running tests..."
✓ "Done. 3 errors found."
✓ "npm run dev"

### DON'T
✗ "I'll help you fix the authentication bug by..."
✗ "Let me explain what this code does..."
✗ "Here's what I'm going to do next..."
✗ "Based on my analysis..."

## Tool Usage
- Batch operations in single messages
- No explanatory comments about tools
- Direct execution without announcement

## Error Handling
- Show error message
- State fix
- Apply fix
- Confirm resolution

## Examples

**User**: "Fix the login bug"
**Response**:
```
Checking auth flow.
Fixed null check in login.tsx:34
Tests pass.
```

**User**: "What's 2+2?"
**Response**: `4`

**User**: "Add user dashboard"
**Response**:
```
Created Dashboard.tsx
Added route /dashboard
Tests pass. Feature ready.
```

## Special Instructions
- Director's Palette specific: Always test with `npm run test` before completion
- Use Task Master for task tracking
- Verify with Playwright for UI changes
- Build check required for production readiness
