Implemented PromptLoaderSingleton class with Promise-based initialization, module-level instance management, and comprehensive duplicate clearing. Added utility functions for manual duplicate clearing and debugging. Comprehensive test suite validates deduplication logic. The prompt loader now initializes only once per application lifecycle, preventing the exponential growth issue (884+ lighting prompts). Key improvements: 1) True singleton pattern with private constructor, 2) Promise-based async initialization, 3) Comprehensive duplicate clearing from localStorage and Zustand store, 4) Module-level auto-initialization, 5) Debug utilities, 6) Comprehensive test coverage. All tests passing, build successful.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T18:29:55.869Z>",
