# UI/UX Fixes Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Based on the Visual UI/UX Audit Report conducted on 2025-09-18, this PRD outlines comprehensive tasks to address all identified issues and improve the overall user experience of Director's Palette.

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Fix Accessibility Issues in Dialogs
**Priority: HIGH**
**Problem**: Console warnings indicate missing DialogTitle components and aria-describedby attributes in Image Library and Prompt Library dialogs, causing accessibility concerns for screen readers.

**Requirements**:
- Add proper DialogTitle components to all dialog implementations
- Include aria-describedby attributes for better screen reader support
- Fix all DialogContent accessibility warnings
- Ensure WCAG compliance for all modal dialogs
- Test with screen readers to verify proper announcement

**Testing**:
- Use Playwright to verify console warnings are resolved
- Test with axe-core accessibility testing tool
- Manual testing with screen reader software
- Deploy sub-agents to research best practices for React dialog accessibility

### 2. Improve Visual Consistency and Spacing
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Problem**: Inconsistent spacing and padding across components, particularly in category cards and button groups.

**Requirements**:
- Conduct comprehensive spacing audit across all components
- Standardize padding values using consistent design tokens
- Fix category cards padding in Prompt Library (increase internal padding)
- Ensure consistent gaps between button groups
- Align all elements according to an 8px grid system
- Create spacing utility classes for consistency

**Testing**:
- Use Playwright to capture before/after screenshots
- Visual regression testing with Percy or similar tool
- Compare screenshots to ensure consistency
- Test across different screen sizes

### 3. Enhance Empty State Designs
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Problem**: Current empty states show plain text messages lacking visual interest and user guidance.

**Requirements**:
- Design visually appealing empty states with icons/illustrations
- Add engaging, helpful messages for empty galleries
- Create different empty state variations for different contexts
- Include call-to-action buttons where appropriate
- Use consistent empty state patterns across entire application
- Add helpful tips or onboarding content in empty states

**Testing**:
- Test all empty states with Playwright
- Capture screenshots of each empty state
- Verify consistent styling and messaging
- Test user journey from empty state to populated state

### 4. Fix Color Contrast Issues
**Priority: HIGH**
**Problem**: Purple text on dark backgrounds may have WCAG contrast issues, affecting readability.

**Requirements**:
- Run comprehensive WCAG contrast analysis on all text elements
- Identify all purple text elements with insufficient contrast
- Adjust colors to meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Consider WCAG AAA standards where possible (7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text)
- Document all color changes in design system
- Update color palette with accessible alternatives

**Testing**:
- Use automated contrast checking tools
- Test with Playwright visual tests
- Manual verification with WCAG contrast checker
- Test with users who have visual impairments

### 5. Code Cleanup and Optimization
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Problem**: Potential duplicate code, bloatware, and components exceeding recommended line limits.

**Requirements**:
- Audit entire codebase for duplicate code patterns
- Identify and remove unused components and imports
- Consolidate similar functions into shared utilities
- Break down large components (>200 lines) into smaller, focused components
- Remove commented-out code and dead code paths
- Optimize bundle size by removing unnecessary dependencies
- Create backup before any major cleanup

**Testing**:
- Run full test suite after each removal
- Use Playwright for comprehensive E2E testing
- Monitor bundle size changes
- Verify no functionality is broken
- Performance testing before and after cleanup

### 6. Comprehensive Testing Suite
**Priority: HIGH**
**Problem**: Need comprehensive testing coverage for all UI components and user flows.

**Requirements**:
- Create Playwright test suite for all UI components
- Add visual regression tests for critical UI elements
- Test all user flows end-to-end
- Add accessibility tests to CI/CD pipeline
- Create tests for responsive design breakpoints
- Implement performance testing for UI interactions
- Document test coverage metrics

**Testing**:
- Run all tests in CI/CD environment
- Verify tests catch intentional breaking changes
- Monitor test execution time
- Ensure tests work across different browsers
- Regular test maintenance and updates

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Accessibility Fixes (Immediate)
- Fix dialog accessibility issues
- Address color contrast problems
- Document changes for compliance

### Phase 2: Visual Polish (Week 1)
- Standardize spacing and padding
- Enhance empty state designs
- Improve visual consistency

### Phase 3: Code Quality (Week 2)
- Code cleanup and optimization
- Component refactoring
- Performance improvements

### Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure (Ongoing)
- Build comprehensive test suite
- Implement visual regression testing
- Set up continuous testing

## Success Criteria

1. Zero accessibility warnings in browser console
2. All text meets WCAG AA contrast standards
3. Consistent spacing across all components
4. Engaging empty states with clear CTAs
5. No components exceed 200 lines
6. 90%+ test coverage for UI components
7. All Playwright tests passing
8. Positive user feedback on visual improvements

## Technical Considerations

- Use React best practices for accessibility
- Leverage Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Implement design tokens for maintainability
- Use sub-agents for specialized tasks (accessibility research, performance optimization)
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring

## Resources Required

- Design team consultation for empty state designs
- Accessibility expert review
- QA team for comprehensive testing
- Sub-agent deployment for research and implementation
