# Director's Palette - Extreme Usage Cost Analysis & Landing Page Strategy

## üö® **EXTREME USAGE SCENARIO ANALYSIS**

### **The Scenario You Described:**
```
Power User Monthly Usage:
- 5 stories generated
- 6 Gen4 image generations per character (avg 3 characters = 18 Gen4 uses per story)  
- 4 videos generated per shot (avg 8 shots per story = 32 videos per story)
- Additional processing and refinements

Total Monthly Operations:
- 5 story generations
- 90 Gen4 image generations (5 stories √ó 18 per story)
- 160 video generations (5 stories √ó 32 per story)
- Character extractions, post-processing, etc.
```

### **Detailed Cost Breakdown:**

#### **Text Generation (Stories + Characters)**
```
5 Stories with Character Extraction:
- Story generation: 5 √ó 10,000 tokens √ó GPT-4o = 5 √ó $0.13 = $0.65
- Character extraction: 5 √ó 5,000 tokens √ó GPT-4o = 5 √ó $0.075 = $0.375
- Text processing total: $1.025
```

#### **Image Generation (Gen4)**
```
90 Gen4 Image Generations:
Based on Replicate pricing research:
- Gen4 Image on Replicate: ~$0.15-0.25 per generation
- Conservative estimate: $0.20 per generation
- 90 generations √ó $0.20 = $18.00
```

#### **Video Generation (Most Expensive)**
```
160 Video Generations (4 per shot):
Based on RunwayML API pricing:
- Gen-4 Turbo: 5 credits/second √ó $0.01 = $0.05/second
- Gen-4 Standard: 12 credits/second √ó $0.01 = $0.12/second
- Assuming 5-second videos with Gen-4 Standard:
- Cost per video: 5 seconds √ó $0.12 = $0.60
- 160 videos √ó $0.60 = $96.00

Alternative with Stable Video Diffusion:
- Estimated ~$0.20 per 4-second video
- 160 videos √ó $0.20 = $32.00
```

#### **EXTREME USER TOTAL MONTHLY COST:**
```
Conservative Estimate (Stable Video):
- Text generation: $1.03
- Image generation: $18.00  
- Video generation: $32.00
- Total: $51.03/month

Expensive Estimate (RunwayML Gen-4):
- Text generation: $1.03
- Image generation: $18.00
- Video generation: $96.00
- Total: $115.03/month
```

## üí∞ **PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS**

### **Can We Make Money at $20/Month?**

**With Conservative Video Costs ($51/month):**
- Revenue: $20/month
- Cost: $51/month
- **Loss: -$31/month** ‚ùå

**With Expensive Video Costs ($115/month):**
- Revenue: $20/month  
- Cost: $115/month
- **Loss: -$95/month** ‚ùå

### **SOLUTION: Tiered Pricing + Rate Limiting**

**Option 1: Video Usage Limits**
```
Creator Pro ($20/month):
- Unlimited text generation (FREE models)
- 50 image generations/month
- 10 video generations/month
- Cost to us: ~$15/month
- Profit: $5/month ‚úÖ

Studio Pro ($100/month):
- Unlimited text generation
- 200 image generations/month
- 50 video generations/month  
- Cost to us: ~$70/month
- Profit: $30/month ‚úÖ
```

**Option 2: Credit System**
```
$20/month = 1,000 credits

Credit Values:
- Text generation (FREE models): 0 credits
- Text generation (premium): 10 credits
- Image generation: 50 credits  
- Video generation: 200 credits

Extreme user would need:
- Text: 5 √ó 10 = 50 credits
- Images: 90 √ó 50 = 4,500 credits
- Videos: 160 √ó 200 = 32,000 credits
- Total: 36,550 credits = $731.00 needed

This user needs Studio tier at $100+ with 10,000+ credits

## üìã **SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS**

### **Cost Analysis Results:**
- **$20/month too low** for extreme video users (would lose $31-95/month)
- **$25/month with video limits** is profitable
- **Rate limiting essential** for video generation
- **Text generation nearly free** with our FREE models

### **Landing Page Strategy:**
- **Three.js + Video hybrid** approach best
- **Scroll-triggered demonstrations** of each feature  
- **Interactive cost calculator** showing credit usage
- **Mobile-optimized** with your 9:16 content

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Review CSV analysis** (`EXTREME-USAGE-ANALYSIS.csv`)
2. **Adjust pricing** to $25/month with video limits
3. **Design credit system** with video rate limiting
4. **Plan Three.js landing page** with scroll animations

**The extreme usage analysis shows we need video rate limiting and slightly higher pricing ($25 vs $20) to handle heavy users profitably while maintaining massive advantages over competitors.**
