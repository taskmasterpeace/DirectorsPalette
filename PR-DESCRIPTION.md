# Fix infinite loop, Vercel build error, and add comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 Summary

This PR resolves critical production issues and adds complete project documentation:
- ✅ Fixed React infinite loop error ("Maximum update depth exceeded")
- ✅ Fixed Vercel build failure ("Cannot read properties of undefined")  
- ✅ Completed technical debt refactoring (792 → 68 lines in app/page.tsx)
- ✅ Added comprehensive README and setup documentation

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### 1. Infinite Loop Error
**Problem:** Application was experiencing "Maximum update depth exceeded" error due to circular state updates.

**Solution:**
- Removed duplicate `loadSessionState` calls
- Fixed useEffect dependencies in `useSessionManagement` hook
- Used `getState()` directly to avoid dependency issues

### 2. Vercel Build Error
**Problem:** Build failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'find')" during static generation.

**Solution:**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to layout.tsx
- Forced dynamic rendering to ensure stores are initialized
- Added default values to store destructuring
- Dynamic import for ProjectManager component

### 3. Module Not Found Warnings
**Problem:** "Module not found: fs/promises" warnings during build.

**Solution:**
- Changed from dynamic `import()` to conditional `require()`
- Added proper client-side checks
- Warnings are now minimized and don't affect functionality

## 🚀 Improvements

### Technical Debt Refactoring
- **Reduced app/page.tsx from 792 to 68 lines** (91% reduction!)
- Created modular hooks for logic extraction:
  - `useSessionManagement`
  - `useStoryGeneration`
  - `useMusicVideoGeneration`
  - `useDirectorManagement`
- Created container components for better organization
- Added error boundaries for robust error handling
- Consolidated server actions into organized modules

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive README.md with:
  - Installation instructions
  - Architecture overview
  - Feature descriptions
  - API reference
  - Deployment guides
  - Troubleshooting section
- Created .env.example for easy setup
- Added contributing guidelines

## ✅ Testing

All features tested and verified working:
```
FINAL SCORE: 12/12 tests passed (100%)
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

- ✅ Camera movement checkbox functionality
- ✅ Director style variations
- ✅ Reference system (@tags)
- ✅ Additional shots generation
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Error boundaries

## 📁 Files Changed

### Created
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `components/containers/` - Container components
- `components/error-boundaries/` - Error handling
- `app/actions/` - Consolidated server actions
- `config/constants.ts` - Centralized configuration
- `README.md` - Complete documentation
- `.env.example` - Environment template
- Test files for validation

### Modified
- `app/page.tsx` - Massively simplified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added force-dynamic and error boundaries
- `components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Fixed state synchronization
- `stores/app-store.ts` - Added missing methods
- `config/*-loader.ts` - Fixed fs import issues

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

None - all existing functionality has been preserved while improving code quality.

## 📝 Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables:** Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
2. **Build Cache:** Clear Vercel's build cache after merging
3. **Branch:** Deploy from main branch
4. **Node Version:** Requires Node.js 18+

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Clone and install:
```bash
git checkout fix/infinite-loop-and-technical-debt
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
node run-feature-tests.js
```

3. Build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 📸 Before/After

### Before
