## Overview
This document outlines the complete feature set and workflow improvements for both Music Video Mode and Story Mode based on user requirements.

## Music Video Mode - Complete Workflow

  - Remove suggestions

#### Wardrobe Panel  
- 1-4 auto-generated wardrobe combinations

  - Combined reference (@d_streetwear, @d_formal, @d_casual)
  - Detailed breakdown:
    - Top: specific shirt/jacket with colors
    - Bottom: pants/shorts with style and fit
    - Footwear: shoes/boots
    - Accessories: jewelry, makeup, hair
  - Which sections this outfit works for
- Allow user to:
  - Edit wardrobe details
  - Create custom combinations
  - Remove suggestions

#### Props Panel
- 1-3 auto-generated prop suggestions

  - Artist: @d_streetwear, @d_formal, etc.
  - Locations: @location1, @location2, etc.
  - Props: @prop1, @prop2, etc.

### Step 4: Final Breakdown Generation (CURRENT - WORKS)
- Uses approved references to generate shots
- Shows final breakdown with sections

- Dropdown to select location (@location1, @location2)
- Dropdown to select props (optional)
- Custom request text (optional)
- Generate button that creates shots using selected references

## Story Mode - Improvements Needed

### Reference System (MISSING)
**All characters, locations, props in one centralized view**

- Allow editing and adding characters

#### Locations Panel

- Features the main character for that chapter
- Describes what we see of the character

- Shows chapter name in quotes
- Features the primary location
- Describes the setting and atmosphere

#### Prop-Based Title Card
