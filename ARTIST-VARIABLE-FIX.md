# Artist Variable Fix - @artist Display Format âœ…

## The Requirement
Display `@artist` as a variable placeholder in all generated shots, NOT the actual artist name. This makes prompts reusable and clearly shows the variable nature.

## What Was Wrong
The system was replacing `@artist` with the actual artist name (e.g., "Ron-Ron") in the output, making shots look specific to one artist instead of being templates.

**Wrong Output:**
```
"Wide shot of Ron-Ron in streetwear ensemble standing confidently..."
```

**Correct Output:**
```
"Wide shot of @artist in streetwear ensemble standing confidently..."
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Artist Name Replacement
**File:** `app/actions/music-video/breakdown.ts`
- Removed the code that replaced `@artist` with the actual artist name
- Added comment explaining why we keep it as a variable

```typescript
// DO NOT replace @artist - keep it as a variable placeholder
// This makes the prompts reusable and shows the variable nature
```

### 2. Updated Additional Shots Generation
**File:** `app/actions/music-video/additional-shots.ts`
- Removed the `.map(shot => shot.replace(/@artist/gi, artistName))` line
- Kept `@artist` as-is in the output
- Updated prompt to not mention actual artist name

### 3. Improved AI Prompts
- Changed prompt instructions to emphasize `@artist` is a variable
- Removed any mention of replacing it with actual names
- Added multiple example shots showing proper usage

### 4. Quick Generate Buttons
- Already correctly using `@artist` format
- Example: "More performance shots of @artist"

## Benefits

1. **Template Reusability**: Shots can be used as templates for any artist
2. **Clear Variable Indication**: Users can see what's a variable vs literal text
3. **Consistency**: All shots use the same variable format
4. **Future Flexibility**: Easy to add more variables like @location, @prop, etc.

## How It Works Now

1. AI generates shots with `@artist` placeholder
2. No post-processing replacement happens
3. Shots display with `@artist` visible to users
4. Users understand it's a variable that represents their artist

## Testing with Ron-Ron Lyrics

When you test with "Respect the Check" by Ron-Ron:
- Shots will display: "Wide shot of @artist in urban setting..."
- NOT: "Wide shot of Ron-Ron in urban setting..."
- This is the correct behavior - `@artist` is a variable placeholder

## Additional Variables (Future)
This pattern can be extended to other variables:
- `@location` - for location references
- `@wardrobe` - for wardrobe items
- `@prop` - for props
- `@time` - for time of day

**Fix complete! The system now correctly displays @artist as a variable placeholder.**
