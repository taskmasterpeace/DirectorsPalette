# üèóÔ∏è Director's Palette - Complete System Architecture Implementation

## üéØ **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

**Objective**: Complete user isolation with per-user credit tracking, admin oversight, and API monitoring for Replicate + OpenRouter.

---

## üìä **IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS**

### **1. ‚úÖ GPT-4o System-Wide Default Configuration**

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/ai-providers/openrouter-config.ts` - Updated all function defaults to GPT-4o
- Added admin configuration save/load functions
- All 8 AI functions now default to GPT-4o as requested

**Admin Control:**
```typescript
// Admin can override any function's model
saveAdminModelConfig({
  'story-breakdown': 'openai/gpt-4o',
  'music-analysis': 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', // Admin choice
  'director-creation': 'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet' // Admin choice
})
```

### **2. ‚úÖ Database Schema for User Isolation**

**File Created:** `lib/database/schema.sql`

**Tables:**
- `user_credits` - Per-user point tracking with monthly allocations
- `usage_log` - Every AI action logged with user_id, model, cost, points
- `boost_purchases` - Boost pack purchase history per user
- `admin_settings` - System-wide admin configurations
- `api_health_log` - API monitoring data

**Row Level Security:**
- Users can only see their own credits/usage
- Admin (taskmasterpeace@gmail.com) can see everything
- Automatic user isolation enforced at database level

### **3. ‚úÖ User Credit Service**

**File Created:** `lib/credits/user-credits.ts`

**Capabilities:**
- Initialize user credits on signup (2500 points for Pro tier)
- Deduct points for AI usage with atomic transactions
- Get daily usage breakdowns for user dashboard
- Add boost pack points with purchase tracking
- Admin: Get all users with usage summaries
- Admin: Get system-wide daily usage totals

### **4. ‚úÖ API Health Monitoring**

**Files Created:**
- `lib/monitoring/api-health.ts` - Health monitoring service
- `app/api/health/openrouter/route.ts` - OpenRouter health checks
- `app/api/health/replicate/gen4/route.ts` - Replicate Gen4 health checks
- `app/api/health/replicate/seedance-light/route.ts` - Seedance health checks

**Monitoring Features:**
- Real-time API status for both Replicate and OpenRouter
- Response time tracking
- Uptime calculations
- Model-specific health checks
- Automatic 5-minute interval monitoring

### **5. ‚úÖ User Dashboard (Settings Page)**

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `app/settings/page.tsx` - Enhanced with usage dashboard
- `components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx` - Complete user analytics

**User Features:**
- Current points balance with monthly allocation progress
- Daily usage charts for last 7 days
- Usage breakdown by action type (story, music, commercial, etc.)
- Usage breakdown by model
- Boost pack purchase interface
- Recent activity history

### **6. ‚úÖ Enhanced Admin Dashboard**

**Files Created:**
- `components/admin/EnhancedAdminDashboard.tsx` - Complete admin interface
- Updated `app/admin/page.tsx` to use enhanced dashboard

**Admin Capabilities:**
- **System Overview**: Active users, total points used, system cost, avg per user
- **Model Configuration**: Set default models for each function system-wide
- **User Management**: View all users with their credit balances and usage
- **API Health**: Real-time status of OpenRouter and Replicate services
- **Analytics**: Revenue vs cost analysis, profit calculations

### **7. ‚úÖ Usage Tracking Middleware**

**File Created:** `lib/middleware/usage-tracking.ts`

**Features:**
- Automatic point calculation based on model pricing
- FREE models = 0 points (unlimited usage)
- Premium models = calculated based on token usage
- Pre-action credit validation
- Post-action point deduction and logging
- Wrapper functions for each action type

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **Database Setup:**
1. Run `schema.sql` in Supabase dashboard
2. Enable Row Level Security policies
3. Test user isolation with multiple accounts

### **Environment Variables:**
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Required for model health checks
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - Required for Replicate monitoring
- Supabase credentials already configured

### **Testing Workflow:**
1. Create test user accounts
2. Verify credit allocation and isolation
3. Test AI actions with point deduction
4. Verify admin can see all user data
5. Test API monitoring dashboard

**üéâ RESULT: Complete enterprise-grade user isolation system with admin oversight, cost tracking, and API monitoring!**
