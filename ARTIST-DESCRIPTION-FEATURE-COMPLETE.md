# Artist Description Replacement Feature - Complete âœ…

## Feature Overview
Users can now provide detailed visual descriptions for artists that replace `@artist` variables in shot descriptions, with a toggle to switch between variable and description views.

## How It Works

### 1. Input Artist Description
In the Music Video Input section, there's a new field:
- **Artist Visual Description**: A text area where users can enter detailed descriptions
- Example: `"Ron-Ron, a confident Black man with gold chains, designer streetwear, face tattoos, and diamond grills"`

### 2. Toggle Display Mode
When a description is provided, toggle buttons appear above the shot lists:
- **"Show @artist"**: Displays shots with `@artist` variable (default)
- **"Show Descriptions"**: Replaces `@artist` with the full description

### 3. Live Preview
The replacement happens in real-time:

**Variable Mode (Show @artist):**
```
"Wide shot of @artist walking through urban streets, golden hour lighting"
```

**Description Mode (Show Descriptions):**
```
"Wide shot of Ron-Ron, a confident Black man with gold chains, designer streetwear, face tattoos, and diamond grills walking through urban streets, golden hour lighting"
```

## Benefits

1. **Visualization**: Helps crew understand exactly who/what to shoot
2. **Flexibility**: Toggle between abstract templates and specific descriptions
3. **Export Options**: Copy with or without descriptions based on needs
4. **Reusability**: Templates remain generic with `@artist` variable
5. **Production Ready**: Detailed descriptions aid in casting and wardrobe

## Testing with Ron-Ron Lyrics

1. Enter song details:
   - Title: "Respect the Check"
   - Artist: "Ron-Ron"
   - Description: "Ron-Ron, a confident Black man with gold chains, designer streetwear, face tattoos, and diamond grills"

2. Generate shots - they'll display with `@artist`

3. Click "Show Descriptions" to see full descriptions in all shots

4. Copy shots - they'll include descriptions if toggle is on

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Variables**: Add `@location`, `@prop`, `@wardrobe`
2. **Context-Aware**: Different descriptions for close-ups vs wide shots
3. **AI Generation**: Generate descriptions from artist profiles
4. **Preset Library**: Save and reuse common descriptions
