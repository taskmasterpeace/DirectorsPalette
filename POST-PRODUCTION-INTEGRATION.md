## Environment Setup

Add to `.env.local`:
```
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_key_here
```

## Dependencies
- Replicate API for image generation
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Zustand for state management
- Radix UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Testing Completed
✅ Tab navigation working
✅ Shot transfer from Director's Palette
✅ Clipboard paste functionality
✅ Reference image upload and management
✅ IndexedDB storage and retrieval
✅ API endpoint generation (tested with Replicate)
✅ Layout Planner drawing and export
✅ Settings panel configuration

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add support for batch generation
2. Implement video generation with Seedance
3. Add more Replicate models
4. Create templates for common shot types
5. Add export to various formats
6. Implement collaborative features

## Known Limitations
1. Reference images don't directly influence generation (Replicate model limitation)
2. Video generation not yet implemented (requires different Replicate models)
3. No real-time collaboration features
4. Limited to Replicate's available models

## Minimal Work Required from User
Everything is fully integrated and ready to use. Simply:
1. Ensure `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is set in `.env.local`
2. Navigate to `/post-production` or use export buttons
3. Start generating images!

The integration preserves all ImageMax functionality while seamlessly connecting with Director's Palette's existing workflow.
