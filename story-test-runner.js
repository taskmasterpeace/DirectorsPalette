const CLEAN_STORY = `# The Story of Clean: When Family Calls, You Answer

## The Call That Changed Everything

Clean's world shifted the moment his phone started blowing up that morning. He's a night owl by nature - the kind of guy who stays up until 6 or 7 AM, lost in his own routine. So when his phone started going crazy while he was still deep in sleep, something in his gut told him this wasn't normal. His brothers and sisters don't call like that. Not all at once. Not with that urgency.

His brother's voice cut through the drowsiness instantly: "Bro, I'm on my way, gang."

"All right, what's going on?"

"He put his hands on sis. Come and get me. It ain't nothing to talk about."

The line went dead. No discussion needed. Ten minutes later, his brother was at his door. Fifteen minutes after that, they were pulling up to the projects.

## What Happened to His Twin

Clean's twin sister - she's just like him, he says, except she doesn't care about the fame or the internet. She keeps to herself, has her own spot, lives her own life. The night before, she'd been with her boyfriend. They'd been drinking, and when things got tense, he got out of the car, acting like he wanted to walk home - mind you, the man doesn't even have a vehicle of his own.

She tried to be reasonable, tried to get him back in the car. "Get back in the car, what are you doing?" But the moment he got back in, something snapped in him. He grabbed her phone right off the charger and hurled it across the parking lot.

Now, Clean makes it clear - his sister isn't the type to take that lying down. She confronted him about throwing her phone, and that's when he hit her. She had to walk around with a swollen face because this man couldn't control himself.

## The Phone Call Before the Storm

Before Clean pulled up, the boyfriend had been talking tough on the phone. Bragging about how many people he'd beaten up in prison, how Clean was so small he'd "break him apart," detailing all the things he was going to do when Clean showed up.

"All right, cool," Clean had said. And he meant it.

The sister had even warned her boyfriend: "You know you're going to have to see my brothers after this."

His response? "F*** them, I don't give a f*** about them ho ass n****s."

## Pulling Up to the Projects

Clean kicked the door. Not knocked - kicked. Three times. "Wayne, bring your ass outside!"

For five minutes, nothing. Clean knew they were in there - the boyfriend, his father, and his brother. They had guns in the house. Clean could picture them scrambling, probably placing weapons strategically, preparing for whatever was about to go down.

The projects were small - walk through the front door, go straight ahead, and you hit the back door. No way they didn't hear him. The neighbors certainly did. Clean was yelling, making sure everyone knew exactly why he was there.

Finally, the father answered. He came out on crutches, looking, as Clean colorfully puts it, "like Lieutenant Dan" - no legs, just crutches.

"I ain't even here to holler at you, my man. Where Lil Wayne at? Tell him to come outside. He know what this is. We talked about this already. Bring your ass outside. You like putting your hands on women. Come outside."

## The Confrontation

When the boyfriend finally emerged, he tried to play it cool, walking toward Clean with open hands. "Bro, what's up, bro? We family."

Clean had warned him immediately: "Don't walk up on me, bro. I'm doing the walking ups. I'm advancing towards you."

But he kept coming. That's when the first slap landed. 

*SMACK.*

"You like putting your hands on females?"

The slaps kept coming. Five, six times. Each one deliberate. Each one recorded by Clean's brother, who Clean had specifically instructed to stay in the car and just film. "This one's mine," Clean had told him. "You had the last one. This is my turn."

Clean's father had always told him that slapping a man multiple times was worse than beating him up. It was about humiliation, about making a point that would stick.

## The Glasses Come Off

The moment that went viral - when Clean slapped the glasses clean off the man's face - happened after the boyfriend's brother acted like he was going to get a gun from the car. The neighbor, who'd been watching the whole thing unfold, even called out the brother for being "b****" for not helping, for walking back into the house while his brother was getting slapped around.

But here's what struck Clean the most: after each slap, when the boyfriend would "unscrew" (back down) and act like he didn't want to fight, Clean would give him another chance. And each time, nothing. No fight back. No resistance. Just taking it.

"My sister got to walk around with a swollen face," Clean said. "So how you think you going to have to walk around now? You got to walk around like a b****, knowing that I smacked the glasses off your face, knowing that every day you go on Facebook, you viral now."`
