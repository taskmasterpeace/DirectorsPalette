# Copy Functionality Implementation - Complete âœ…

## Overview
Successfully implemented copy functionality for individual shots and multi-select copying in both MusicVideoMode and StoryMode components.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Individual Shot Copy Buttons
- **Hover-activated copy button** on each shot
- **Toast notification** when copied
- Works for both regular and additional shots
- Non-intrusive design (only visible on hover)

### 2. Multi-Select Functionality
- **Selection mode toggle** button to enable/disable selection
- **Checkboxes** appear in selection mode
- **Visual highlighting** for selected shots (amber border for Story, purple for Music Video)
- **Click to select/deselect** shots
- **"Copy Selected" button** with count indicator

### 3. Bulk Copy Options
- **"Select Chapter/Section"** - Selects all shots in a chapter/section
- **"Copy Chapter/Section"** - Copies all shots from a chapter/section
- **"Copy All"** - Copies all shots from all chapters/sections

## Implementation Details

### MusicVideoMode.tsx Changes
```typescript
// Added state for selection
const [selectedShots, setSelectedShots] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
const [isSelectionMode, setIsSelectionMode] = useState(false)

// Individual shot copy
const handleCopyShot = (shot: string) => {
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(shot)
  toast({ title: "Copied!", description: "Shot copied to clipboard" })
}

// Multi-select copy
const copySelectedShots = () => {
  // Copies all selected shots with double line breaks
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(shotsToCopy.join('\n\n'))
}
```

### StoryMode.tsx Changes
- Identical implementation pattern to MusicVideoMode
- Amber color scheme for selection highlights (vs purple for music video)
- Includes both regular shots and additional shots in selection

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- **Selection highlighting**: Selected shots have colored borders
- **Hover states**: Copy buttons appear on hover
- **Toast notifications**: Confirm successful copy operations
- **Button states**: Clear visual distinction for selection mode

### Workflow
1. User can copy individual shots by hovering and clicking copy button
2. For bulk operations:
   - Click "Select Shots" to enter selection mode
   - Click shots or use "Select Chapter" for bulk selection
   - Click "Copy Selected (X)" to copy all selected shots
   - Selection mode can be cancelled anytime

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Individual shot copy in MusicVideoMode
- [x] Multi-select in MusicVideoMode
- [x] Individual shot copy in StoryMode
- [x] Multi-select in StoryMode
- [x] Copy all functionality
- [x] Toast notifications
- [x] Visual feedback (borders, hover states)
- [x] Build passes without errors

## Code Quality
- **Type safety**: Proper TypeScript types maintained
- **Performance**: Efficient Set operations for selection tracking
- **Accessibility**: Proper click handlers and keyboard support
- **Consistency**: Same UX patterns across both modes

## User Benefits
1. **Efficiency**: Quick access to copy any shot
2. **Flexibility**: Copy single shots or multiple selections
3. **Organization**: Easy to copy shots from specific chapters/sections
4. **Professional workflow**: Export shot lists for production documents

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+A for select all, Ctrl+C for copy)
- Add paste functionality to reorder shots
- Add export to different formats (CSV, PDF)
- Add shot numbering in copied text
