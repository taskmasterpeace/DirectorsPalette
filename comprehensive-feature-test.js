City lights blur past my window
Racing through these neon streets
Digital love in the shadows
Where the future and the past meet

[Chorus]
We're living in neon dreams
Nothing is quite what it seems
Electric hearts beat as one
Dancing till the night is done

[Verse 2]
Synthetic waves crash over me
Lost in this electric maze
Your hologram is all I see
Through the purple smoky haze

Download my soul tonight
Upload your love to me
In this digital paradise
We can finally be free`,

Warriors stand with shields held high
The king has fallen, fate is sealed
Under blood-red morning sky

Broken crown upon the ground
Empire's falling, hear the sound
Rise up from the ashes now
We will never bow

Steel clashes in the burning night
Rebellion surges through our veins
Freedom's calling, join the fight
Break these tyranny chains`,
