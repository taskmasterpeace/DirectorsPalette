// ACTUAL END-TO-END TEST - Test the real system right now

const testStory = `Detective Martinez walked into the abandoned warehouse at midnight. The killer was waiting for her in the shadows, holding a red balloon. "You're too late," he whispered as the balloon floated up toward the broken skylight.

She drew her gun, but her hands were shaking. This was personal - the killer had taken her partner three months ago. The balloon reached the ceiling and popped, echoing through the empty space like a gunshot.

"Drop the weapon!" she shouted, but he was already running toward the back exit. She gave chase, her footsteps echoing on the concrete floor, determined to end this tonight.`
