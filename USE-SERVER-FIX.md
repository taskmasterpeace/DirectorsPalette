# "use server" Fix - Critical for Exports

## The Problem
`TypeError: extractMusicVideoReferences is not a function`

Even though the functions were exported, they weren't recognized as server actions.

## The Solution
Added `'use server'` directive to ALL index files that re-export server actions:

### Files Fixed:
1. `/app/actions/index.ts` - Main export file
2. `/app/actions/story/index.ts` - Story exports
3. `/app/actions/music-video/index.ts` - Music video exports

## Why This Matters

When re-exporting server actions through index files, EACH index file needs `'use server'` at the top.

### Export Chain:
```
references.ts ('use server') 
  ↓
music-video/index.ts ('use server' NEEDED)
  ↓
actions/index.ts ('use server' NEEDED)
  ↓
Component can now import and use
```

## The Rule

**EVERY file that exports server actions needs `'use server'` at the top**, including:
- Original action files ✅
- Index files that re-export ✅
- Any intermediate export files ✅

## Testing

Both modes should now work:

### Music Video Mode
```typescript
import { extractMusicVideoReferences } from '@/app/actions'
// This now works because all export files have 'use server'
```

### Story Mode
```typescript
import { extractStoryReferences } from '@/app/actions'
// This now works because all export files have 'use server'
```

## Key Learning

Next.js server actions require the `'use server'` directive in:
1. The file where the function is defined
2. ANY file that re-exports the function

Without this, the function won't be recognized as a server action and will fail when called from client components.

## Status

✅ All export files now have `'use server'`
✅ Server actions properly exposed
✅ Client components can call them directly
✅ App should be fully functional
