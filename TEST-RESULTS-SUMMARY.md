## Key Findings

### Director Styles Produce Different Outputs âœ…
The prompt templates properly incorporate director-specific styling:
- Each director has unique visual language attributes

### Camera Movement Control Works âœ…
The `includeCameraStyle` parameter correctly controls whether camera movements are included in the generated prompts.

### Reference System Functional âœ…
Both story and music video modes properly handle @-prefixed references for:
- Consistent character/location/prop references
- Artist-wardrobe combinations in music videos
- Cross-shot continuity

### Additional Shots Integration âœ…
The system supports adding custom shots with:
- Category-based generation (action, closeup, etc.)
- Custom request integration
- Proper formatting and reference handling

## Recommendations

### Already Implemented:
1. âœ… Technical debt resolved
2. âœ… Navigation fixed
3. âœ… Mode switching working
4. âœ… Reference systems operational
5. âœ… Director styles integrated

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
1. Add more granular director style attributes
2. Implement prompt caching for faster regeneration
3. Add more shot categories for additional shots
4. Create director style preview/comparison tool
5. Add prompt refinement based on user feedback

## Conclusion

All requested features have been tested and verified:
- âœ… Camera movement checkbox controls output
- âœ… Different directors produce unique styles
- âœ… Reference systems work in both modes
- âœ… Additional shots can be added
- âœ… Prompts are high quality and consistent

The application is fully functional with all technical debt resolved and features working as expected.
