## üé® Visual Design Observations

### Positive Aspects
1. **Consistent Dark Theme**: The interface maintains a cohesive dark blue/purple color scheme
2. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Buttons, inputs, and sections are well-delineated
3. **Icon Usage**: Good use of icons for categories and actions
4. **Modal Design**: Dialogs have proper backdrop overlay and centered positioning

### Areas for Visual Improvement

#### 1. Dialog Headers
- **Issue**: Missing proper DialogTitle components (console warnings)
- **Impact**: Accessibility concerns
- **Recommendation**: Add proper title components to dialogs

#### 2. Spacing and Padding
- **Observation**: Some areas could benefit from more consistent spacing
- **Specific Areas**:
  - Category cards in Prompt Library could have more padding
  - Button groups could have more consistent gaps

#### 3. Empty State Design
- **Current**: Plain text messages for empty states
- **Recommendation**: Add more visual interest with illustrations or larger icons

#### 4. Color Contrast
- **Observation**: Some purple text on dark backgrounds may have contrast issues
- **Recommendation**: Test with WCAG contrast checker and adjust as needed

## üêõ Technical Issues Found

### Console Warnings
1. **DialogContent accessibility warnings**: Missing Description or aria-describedby
2. **DialogTitle requirement**: DialogContent requires DialogTitle for screen readers
3. **Failed resource loads**: 404 errors for some assets

### Recommendations for Resolution
1. Add proper DialogTitle components to all dialogs
2. Include aria-describedby attributes for dialog descriptions
3. Fix missing asset references

## üìä Performance Observations
- **Page Load**: Quick and responsive
- **Dialog Opening**: Instant with no lag
- **Navigation**: Smooth transitions between tabs

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Task #49)
1. Add DialogTitle components to fix accessibility warnings
2. Improve spacing consistency across components
3. Enhance empty state designs

### Future Enhancements (Task #50)
1. Add loading states for async operations
2. Implement hover effects for better interactivity
3. Add transition animations for smoother UX
4. Test with actual nano-banana template data

## Screenshots Captured
1. `image-library-dialog.png` - Image Reference Library in dialog mode
2. `prompt-library-dialog.png` - Prompt Library main view
3. `prompt-library-categories.png` - Prompt Library categories view

## Conclusion
The core functionality of the Library buttons and dialogs is working as intended. The @ reference system placeholder text is visible, and the nano-banana model is selectable. While the functionality is solid, there are opportunities for visual polish and accessibility improvements that should be addressed in the next iteration.
