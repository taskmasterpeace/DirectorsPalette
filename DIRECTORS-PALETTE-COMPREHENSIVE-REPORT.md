## üé≠ **DIRECTOR NAMES LEGAL STRATEGY**

### **Current Implementation Risk Assessment**
```
HIGH RISK Names (Remove before prime time):
- Living directors (Spike Lee, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villeneuve)
- Trademarked styles or direct quotes
- Specific copyrighted visual techniques

MEDIUM RISK Names (Proceed with caution):
- Deceased directors with active estates (Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa)
- Well-known but generic style descriptions
- "School of" or "Style of" references

LOW RISK Approaches (Safe for prime time):
- Generic style descriptions ("Cerebral Sci-Fi", "Kinetic Action")
- Era-based styles ("1970s Thriller", "Modern Noir")
- Technical descriptions ("IMAX-scale", "Handheld Documentary")
```

### **Recommended Transition Strategy**
```
Phase 1: Style Category Replacement
- "Christopher Nolan" ‚Üí "Cerebral Sci-Fi Style"
- "Martin Scorsese" ‚Üí "Kinetic Character-Driven Style"  
- "Wes Anderson" ‚Üí "Symmetrical Whimsical Style"
- "Denis Villeneuve" ‚Üí "Atmospheric Contemplative Style"
- "David Fincher" ‚Üí "Clinical Precision Style"

Phase 2: Generic Professional Categories
- "Epic Blockbuster Style"
- "Indie Drama Style"
- "Documentary Realism Style"
- "Fantasy Adventure Style"
- "Psychological Thriller Style"
- "Romantic Comedy Style"
- "Action Spectacle Style"

Phase 3: Technical Approach Focus
- "IMAX-scale Cinematography"
- "Handheld Intimate Style"
- "Steadicam Flowing Style"
- "Fixed Frame Composition"
- "Dynamic Camera Movement"
```

### **Legal Protection Strategy**
```
Implementation:
1. Remove all living director names immediately before launch
2. Replace with generic but descriptive style categories
3. Focus on technical and emotional descriptors
4. Avoid direct quotes or trademarked terminology
5. Use "inspired by" language where necessary

Alternative Approach:
- Partner with emerging directors for endorsed styles
- Create original style categories
- Commission custom style guides
- Build proprietary director database
