## 📱 **MOBILE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY**

### **Progressive Enhancement:**
```javascript
// Detect device capabilities
const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768;
const isLowPower = navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4;

if (isMobile || isLowPower) {
  // Simplified 3D scenes
  // More video content, less 3D processing
  // Touch-optimized interactions
} else {
  // Full Three.js experience
  // Complex particle systems
  // Advanced lighting effects
}
```

### **Performance Considerations:**
- **Lazy loading**: Load 3D scenes as user scrolls
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Reduce 3D complexity on mobile
- **Intersection Observer**: Only animate visible sections
- **Video optimization**: Adaptive bitrate for mobile

- Shows how stories break down into reusable components

**2. "Model Intelligence" Particles:**
- Different colored particles for each AI model
- FREE models glow with special effects
- Particles flow showing cost-effectiveness

**3. "Creative Pipeline" Conveyor:**
- 3D conveyor belt showing workflow
- Story → Characters → Shots → Videos
- Interactive stops where users can explore

**4. "Character Consistency" Morphing:**
- 3D character models that transform
- @character_name tags maintaining identity
- Shows consistency across different scenes

## 🎬 **VIDEO + THREE.JS INTEGRATION**

### **Hybrid Approach Benefits:**

**Three.js Provides:**
- **Immersive backgrounds** for your video content
- **Interactive elements** that respond to scroll
- **Smooth transitions** between sections
- **Performance optimization** (only animate visible areas)

**Your Videos Provide:**
- **Real product demonstrations** (actual functionality)
- **Authentic examples** (real generations, not mockups)
- **Mobile showcases** (9:16 format perfect for device mockups)
- **Proof of concept** (show it actually working)

### **Integration Examples:**
```javascript
// Video playing within 3D scene
<Canvas>
  <VideoTexture src="/demo-16-9.mp4" />
  <Plane geometry={[16, 9]} material={videoMaterial} />
  <ScrollTrigger>
    {/* Play video when section is visible */}
  </ScrollTrigger>
</Canvas>

// Device mockup with your 9:16 content
<iPhone3D>
  <VideoScreen src="/mobile-demo-9-16.mp4" />
  <TouchRippleEffect />
</iPhone3D>
```

## 💰 **PRICING PAGE STRATEGY**

### **Interactive Credit Calculator:**
```javascript
// Real-time cost calculation based on usage
const calculateMonthlyCost = (usage) => {
  const textGenerations = usage.stories * 10; // FREE models
  const imageGenerations = usage.images * 50; // 50 credits each
  const videoGenerations = usage.videos * 200; // 200 credits each
  
  return {
    credits: textGenerations + imageGenerations + videoGenerations,
    cost: (imageGenerations + videoGenerations) * 0.01 // Our cost
  };
};

// 3D visualization of credit usage
<CreditMeter value={usage.credits} max={tierLimit} />
<SavingsParticles amount={competitorPrice - ourPrice} />
```

### **Competitive Advantage Visualization:**
```
Show competitor pricing exploding away while ours stays affordable:
- Midjourney $60 → ⚡💥 (particles disperse)
- RunwayML $95 → ⚡💥 (particles disperse)  
- LTX Studio $125 → ⚡💥 (particles disperse)
- Director's Palette $25 → ✨ (golden glow)
```
